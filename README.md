#####Crypto Micro Trader

The goal of CMT is to provide an interface to creating and utilizing various market analysis functions and using this data to place buy and sell trades on supported exchanges. Coinbase Pro will be the first supported exchange as a proof of concept has already been performed. Future exchanges under consideration are Bittrex and Kraken, however, these exchanges will not be integrated until further basic functionality of the CMT platform are done.

Along with analysis tools and trade execution, we aim to provide reporting and statistics to aid in decision making processes.

This document will be updated as the platform functionality is built.
